Predicting if a customer buys MM or CH brand

This was a simple project in R, using stored a stored data set.
The goal was to use a classifcation tree in order to begin to predict
whether a customer would purchase a certain brand of orange juice.
The data had 1070 observations on 18 variables.  After the classificatoin tree
was executed I created a confusion matrix in order to obtain the accuracy of the prediction.
This model was not too successful with only a 78% accuracy.
